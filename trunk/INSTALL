Construo Installation V0.2.0
============================

Construo should be compilable on every Unix like OS with X11 libraries
installed, no extra libraries beside the X11 libraries and header
files are required (make sure that you have the x11-devel packages of
your distro installed if you not already have).

However Construo can make use of OpenGL via the Glut library, if it is
available, the ./configure script should find that out itself and
create the Glut binaries if the needed libraries are found.

After configuration you will see a line like:

   Targets  =  construo.x11 construo.glut construo.freeglut

Which will tell you which display targets will be build. If you are
happy with that, simply call 'make' which will build all targets.

Once make is finished you should have one or construo.* binaries
available, where * is the name of the display target. These binaries
should be runable from the current directory, there is no need to
install them and installation isn't recomment and hasn't been tested
much.


Compile Summary:
================

To configure and compile construo type:

 % ./configure
 % make

To run construo type:

 % ./construo.x11 # or one of the other available binaries

There is no need to install construo, it will run from its current
directory. './construo.x11 --help' will show you some available
options (fullscreen, etc.), but not all of them will work with all
targets.


Problems:
=========

If you encounter compilation problems which you can't solve, write a mail to:

  Ingo Ruhnke <grumbel@gmx.de>

Generic usage instructions for the ./configure script can be found in
the file INSTALL.configure.
