Installing Construo
===================

To compile Construo you should only need to do:

 % ./configure
 % make

The configure script should automatically detect which libraries will
be available and build the correct binaries. The OpenGL version of
construo is callect 'construo.glut' and the Xlib version is called
'construo.x11', simply run the target which you like better. You can
run Construo directory from its source directory, so there is no need
to install it, but if you want to do so, you can do it by:

 % make install
