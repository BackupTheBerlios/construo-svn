Construo
~~~~~~~~

Construo is a programm for constructing wire-frame objects and let
them react on physical forces, its neither a real simulation nor a
real game, its just a little toy app which can be a nice way to waste
time. Some game-like elements might follow later, see the file 'TODO'.
For an introduction in the usage of the programm see the file
'TUTORIAL', installation and compile instructions can be fonud in the
file 'INSTALL'.
