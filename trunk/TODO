Release 0.1.1:
* fix speed bug
* make it non-deterministic again
* add max particle count
* fix broken demos (complex*, explode, ...)
* fix assertion on broken files
* author field (gcos filtering missing)
* date field
* addd gettext support
* invisible springs 

probally FIXED:
* if I load-file, run, stop, connect, run, stop, undo I get a
  corrupt scene with connections where they don't belong (undo-bug)
  [id bug, ids override each other]


Release 0.2.0:
* update Changelog
* config file support and an option menu to switch off stress-color,
   change the coloring scheme and things like that
* update Changelog
* Create GUI (simple buttons)
* make every key bound function accessible via the GUI
* make the window resizable
* zooming
* thumbnail loading
* 

Release 0.3.0:
* make OpenGL display implementation, add alpha support (can be faked
  by fading to black on non-alpha displays)
* port to windows

--- in the future ---
 - screensaver mode
 - add different types of sticks
 - make stick properties editable
 - add a better load/save interface
 - make it 3D
 - add some randomness
 - add wind/earthquake or other things
 - make use of non-flad ground
 - add zoom

 - add constrained, scenarios with a limited number of
   particles/sticks and things like that, add mission goals

--- User contributed ---
 - Capability to connect springs into the middle of another spring
   [grumbel: don't think this is a good idea]

 - Objects that cannot be penetrated with wire.
   [grumbel: doesn't mix with physic engine, objects that can't be
   penetrated by particles will come]
 
 - Capability to adjust individual parameters of springs. 
   [grumbel: might come, but will be limited]

 - A macro language (yes, lisp is fine, there seems to be some code
   for it). [grumbel: won't come, overkill, use scripting language to
   create the construo file instead]

 - Concept of object (grouping of lines / other objects). [grumbel:
   might come with the prefabs, but most likly only 'passive' so that
   you can mark and move groups, permanent groups are unlikly]

 - Capability to store and load objects. [grumbel: prefabs will come]

 - Colors, texture mapping for new object types. [grumbel: might come,
   but not very soon]

 - Sounds (I want to hear the constructions crashing..). [grumbel:
   would require extra library, not good]

 - Backdrop graphics [grumbel: if they come not very soon].

 - Active elements.[grumbel: earthquake particles will come]


Modes for Construo - The Game
-----------------------------
 * remove a spring and hope that the tower doesn't fall, multiplayer
   game, played in a round, player that crashes the tower is out,
   multiple rounds will be played, several stable objects must be
   provided.
 * hot-fixing, the player has to stablelize a falling structure in
   slow-motion mode, if he fixes it he wins, else he loses
 * task-force, player as to complete some task, like build a bridge or
   something else with limited resources
 * demo mode, let a bunch of machines do things automatically, insert
   some text here and there
