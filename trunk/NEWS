Construo 0.1.0
==============

 * fixed-particles are now possible
 
 * in-game help screen available

 * removal of particles is possible

 * load/save now with thumbnails and without filenames

 * rewritten to use only plain Xlib, no additional libraries required

 * XML is replaced by s-expressions, this removes another library
   dependency and results in better readable files

 * added abstraction layer, ports to other libraries or OSs should be
   quite easy (OpenGL port might follow sooner or later)
