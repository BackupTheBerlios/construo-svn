1. Introduction
================

This is the wonderful sequel to the "Construo House of Horror".
Still not much technical knowledge about construction, but at
least a whacky load of silly ideas. So have a laugh, while lots
of stick-men get tortured, ripped apart or crushed :)
Actually these constructions are pretty interesting as well,
because they demonstrate a lot of possibilities in the Construo
program, like for instance:
The first construction in the package resembles a vehicle with
rotating wheels (although the vehicle doesn't move very far).
The vehicle construction only takes two stickmen lives, but
I'll make it up to you in the other constructions :)


2. What are the files in this package?
=======================================

The ".construo"-files, which you will find in this package,
are saved constructions created with Construo V0.1.0.


3. Installation notes
======================

Follow these steps into stick-man hell:

 1) Make a backup of your previous Construo constructions
    (they're usually located in $HOME/.construo):
	cd $HOME/.construo
	mkdir backup
	cp *.construo backup

 2) Go back to the directory where you unpacked these files.
    Copy the CHoH2 constructions into home Construo directory:
	cp *.construo $HOME/.construo

 3) START CONSTRUO!
    (if installed into system, just type "construo" without the quotes)

IMPORTANT: When you run the constructions (numbered 1-9), you
must turn on SLOW-MOTION (space-bar) or else you won't get
to see the fun :) Another important thing to notice is that,
in the first run not all constructions work like I intended,
but they should work fine if you press 'u' (undo) while running
and then start the simulation again (that is, as to V0.1.0).

Have fun!


4. Construction list (yeah, I named my inventions, too)
========================================================

NOTE: Some of these constructions seem to be hogging quite
      some CPU power. I simulated them on a 1200 MHz machine,
      so whether you need to turn on SLOW-MOTION or not of course
      depends on your processor speed. You do the math...

Savegame | Name
       1 | Death wheels
       2 | Boulder Crash
       3 | No Arms, No Escape
       4 | Beer Can of Death :o)
       5 | The Terrible End of a Happy Family
       6 | Heavy-weight Punishment
       7 | Wheel of Bad Luck
       8 | Hang On To Your Short Lives
       9 | Slow Death, Painful Death


5. Last words from the author
==============================

I take NO responsibilities as to whatever harm these barbarian
constructions do to you, your dog or your kids. They are NOT
serious in any way and should NOT be treated as such.
And as they say on the Jackass show: "Don't try this at home!"

I'm surprised you even read this far... Go on! Try it out!
