Installing Construo
===================

Construo doesn't depend on any other library beside Xlib, so a normal:

 % ./configure
 % make

should work. Optionally you can run:

 % make install

to install the game, but you can also simply run it from its source
directory. To start it from the source directory just type:

 % ./construo

or if you want to launch an example, type:

 % ./construo examples/<filename>.construo

If you have construo xml files from an earlier release, you can
convert them with them with the xml2sexpr.sh script like this:

 % xml2sexpr.sh < oldfile.xml > newfile.construo

# EOF #
