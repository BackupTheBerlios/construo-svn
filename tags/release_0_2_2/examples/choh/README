1. Introduction
================

I created the "Construo House of Horror" in 6 hours or so.
No technical knowledge about construction, but a whacky load
of silly ideas. So have a laugh, while lots of stick-men get
tortured, ripped apart or crushed :)
Actually these constructions are pretty interesting as well,
because they demonstrate a lot of possibilities in the Construo
program, like for instance:
I created a giant and (somewhat) functional windmill. But of
course the windmill had to kill four stick-men to make it
horrifying :)


2. What are the files in this package?
=======================================

The ".construo"-files, which you will find in this package,
are saved constructions created with Construo V0.1.0.


3. Installation notes
======================

Follow these steps into stick-man hell:

 1) Make a backup of your previous Construo constructions
    (they're usually located in $HOME/.construo):
	cd $HOME/.construo
	mkdir backup
	cp *.construo backup

 2) Go back to the directory where you unpacked these files.
    Copy the CHoH constructions into home Construo directory:
	cp *.construo $HOME/.construo

 3) START CONSTRUO!
    (if installed into system, just type "construo" without the quotes)

IMPORTANT: When you run the constructions (numbered 0-9), you
must turn on SLOW-MOTION (space-bar) or else you won't get
to see the fun :) Another important thing to notice is that,
in the first run not all constructions work like I intended,
but they should work fine if you press 'u' (undo) while running
and then start the simulation again (that is, as to V0.1.0).

Have fun!


4. Construction list (yeah, I named my inventions, too)
========================================================

NOTE: Some of these constructions seem to be hogging quite
      some CPU power. I simulated them on a 1200 MHz machine,
      so whether you need to turn on SLOW-MOTION or not of course
      depends on your processor speed. You do the math...

Savegame | Name
       0 | Ropes and stones may break thy bones
       1 | Two words: Ripped apart
       2 | The day of Arnold's defeat
       3 | The Windmill of Horror :o)
       4 | The head-rip-off-scales
       5 | Scales of Destruction
       6 | Hangman
       7 | Let the body hit the floor
       8 | Die, and stay dead
       9 | My first creation. Not horrifying at all.

Construction 9 really hasn't got anything to do with horror
and death. It's my first creation, and it only breaks about
two bones or so (but it looks funny :).


5. Last words from the author
==============================

I take NO responsibilities as to whatever harm these barbarian
constructions do to you, your dog or your kids. They are NOT
serious in any way and should not be treated as such.

I'm surprised you even read this far... Go on! Try it out!
