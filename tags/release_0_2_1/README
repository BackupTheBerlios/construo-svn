Construo V0.2.1
===============

Construo is a programm for constructing wire-frame objects and let
them react on physical forces, its neither a real simulation nor a
real game, its just a little toy app which can be a nice way to waste
time. Some game-like elements might follow later, see the file 'TODO'.
Installation and compile instructions can be fonud in the file
'INSTALL'.

The newest version can be found at:
