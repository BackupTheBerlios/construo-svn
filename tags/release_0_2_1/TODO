Release 0.2.1:
* update Changelog
* fix assertion on broken files
* fix broken demos (complex*, explode, ...)
* fix make install
* let it act nicly on the lack of examples/ directory

Release 0.3.0:
* Magnetic forces, aka gravity forces which reflect some particles and
   attract others 
* config file support and an option menu to switch off stress-color,
  change the coloring scheme and things like that
* make the window resizable
* author field (gcos filtering missing)
* date field
* addd gettext support
* invisible springs 
* fix speed bug (unknown)
* make it non-deterministic again (
* port to windows

--- in the future ---
 - screensaver mode
 - add different types of sticks
 - make stick properties editable
 - add a better load/save interface
 - make it 3D (not that doable, since it would require a completly
   other type of editor, but physics-vise its pretty simply)
 - add some randomness
 - add wind/earthquake or other things
 - make use of non-flad ground
 - add zoom

 - add constrained, scenarios with a limited number of
   particles/sticks and things like that, add mission goals

--- User contributed ---
 - Capability to connect springs into the middle of another spring
   [grumbel: don't think this is a good idea, the physics model
   doesn't work like this]

 - Objects that cannot be penetrated with wire.
   [grumbel: doesn't mix with physic engine, objects that can't be
   penetrated by particles will come]
 
 - Capability to adjust individual parameters of springs. 
   [grumbel: might come, but will be limited]

 - A macro language (yes, lisp is fine, there seems to be some code
   for it). [grumbel: won't come, overkill, use scripting language to
   create the construo file instead]

 - Concept of object (grouping of lines / other objects). [grumbel:
   might come with the prefabs, but most likly only 'passive' so that
   you can mark and move groups, permanent groups are unlikly]

 - Capability to store and load objects. [grumbel: prefabs will come]

 - Colors, texture mapping for new object types. [grumbel: might come,
   but not very soon]

 - Sounds (I want to hear the constructions crashing..). [grumbel:
   would require extra library, not good, but might come somewhen]

 - Backdrop graphics [grumbel: if they come not very soon].

 - Active elements.[grumbel: earthquake particles will come]


Modes for Construo - The Game
-----------------------------
 * remove a spring and hope that the tower doesn't fall, multiplayer
   game, played in a round, player that crashes the tower is out,
   multiple rounds will be played, several stable objects must be
   provided.
 * hot-fixing, the player has to stablelize a falling structure in
   slow-motion mode, if he fixes it he wins, else he loses
 * task-force, player as to complete some task, like build a bridge or
   something else with limited resources
 * demo mode, let a bunch of machines do things automatically, insert
   some text here and there
